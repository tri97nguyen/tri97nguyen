# Hi! I'm Tri (like a tree) ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy building fullstack application and focus particularly on the JavaScript MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.) 
In addition, I have experience in design patterns and working with MVC enterprise framework like ASP.Net Core.

## Self-taught Project: Restaurant App (MERN stack and Google Firestore Serverless Technology)

My proudest project is a restaurant application where I had to do everything myself, from ideation to implementation. This application is the culmination of my self-taught journey in learning JavaScript fullstack ecosystem. It reflects my learning milestones. As I progress on the learning path, I have supplanted Redux with Context API, migrating class component to functional component using hooks. Most recently, I have detached from the backend to connect to Google Firestore to store and retrieve data.

## Software Engineering Project working with real-world client (ASP.NET CORE)

I have done a 2-semseter long project using ASP.Net Core to build a student assessment software for my university. I led a team  of 4 to develop the foundational codebase for the system. Coming into the project, I'd never worked with .NET Core, so it was a steep learning experience but also a rewarding one. 

Aside from teaching myself ASP.NET Core, the MVC pattern and MySQL afterclass, I had a chance to work in an AGILE fashion with my team and collaborate directly with a real-world client. The project not only taught me solid ASP.Net Core but I also learned to be a better team player.

## Software Engineering Project focusing on Design Patterns (Java)

This project is where I really had a chance to flex these design pattern skills. Through the Tower Defense game created by Java Swing library, I employed multiple classic "Gang of Four" design patterns to build scalable and maintainable application. Furthermore, I applied many object-oriented principles like encapsulation, abstraction, well-behaved class and organizing code into semantic packages to further streamline the maintainability. 

Again, I had a chance to collaborate with 3 other wonderful classmates. We went from pair programming to "mob" programming and learn how to function as a team member. Without them, this project wouldn't have finished.
